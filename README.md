Mochi is a powerful bot for Discord coding in python. It can interact with an online dashboard (feature under development), it has a very complete music part using [Lavalink](https://github.com/Frederikam/Lavalink) and many other features developed or under development.

The bot will be divided into two parts, one opensource and another that will communicate with a database, the latter will be private.
