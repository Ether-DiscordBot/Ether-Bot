# Features

First, look at this gorgeous music player!<br>

And now, let me talk about **Playlists**, the coolest feature of Æther!<br>
You can setup a playlist on your server using the `/music playlist <playlist link>` command. <br>
And react later to the bot message at any time to play the playlist in one click.

And It's how this look: <br>

Æther has many other non-music feature such as **birthday reminder**, **memes maker**, **DnD helper**, **admin stuff**, **quiet level system** and a tone of other things to play with.

If you have any ideas you want the bot to have, feel free to join the [support server](https://discord.gg/YTWUCufwjY) and publish your request or post your idea on [GitHub](https://github.com/Ether-DiscordBot/Ether-Bot/discussions).
