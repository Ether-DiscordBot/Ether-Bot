Aether Privacy Policy
=====================


Last revised on 30/11/2023

### Introduction

Aether is a Discord bot developed by Aether-DiscordBot. Aether collects information about Discord users in order to provide its services. This Privacy Policy explains what information Aether collects, how Aether uses that information, and how users can control their privacy.

### Information Aether Collects

Aether collects the following information about Discord users:

    - User ID: Aether collects the Discord user ID of each user who interacts with Aether. This ID is used to identify users and to associate them with their activity on Discord.
    - Server IDs: Aether collects the IDs of the Discord servers on which each user interacts with Aether. This information is used to determine which servers Aether should provide its services to.
    - Message IDs: Aether collects the IDs of certain messages that each user sends. This information is used for statistical analysis, but users are not personally identifiable in the statistics.
    - Command Usage: Aether collects information about which commands each user uses. This information is used for statistical analysis, but users are not personally identifiable in the statistics.

### How Aether Uses Information

Aether uses the information it collects for the following purposes:

    - To provide its services: Aether uses the information it collects to provide its services to Discord users. This includes identifying users, associating users with their activity on Discord, and providing statistical analysis.
    - To improve its services: Aether uses the information it collects to improve its services. This includes identifying trends in user behavior and making changes to Aether to improve its usability and effectiveness.

### How Users Can Control Their Privacy

Discord users can control their privacy in the following ways:

    - Discord privacy settings: Discord users can control their privacy settings in Discord. These settings control how much information Discord collects about users and how that information is used.
    - Aether settings: Because Aether uses the minimum possible information to operate and that information is public, it is not yet possible to fully control the data recorded by Aether.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

Aether-DiscordBot may change this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted to this page.
